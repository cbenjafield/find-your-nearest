# Find Your Nearest

Find Your Nearest is a WordPress plugin that allows the visitor of a website to enter their postcode and be presented with the nearest locations (branches, stores, area covered) to their location.

An example of this search is present on the [driveJohnson's website](https://www.drivejohnsons.co.uk/learners/areas-we-cover/).

## Usage

### Shortcodes

This plugin comes with some predefined shortcodes out of the box. 

`[fyn-search-form]` will output a search form containing a text input field for the postcode and a search button. You can create your own shortcodes though. As long as you give your form the class of `fyn-form` and an input with the name `postcode` is submitted with the form, and there is an empty `div` with the class of `fyn-results`, the plugin will take care of the rest.

	Example coming soon
